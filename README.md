# SQL_HR-Employee-Analytics

This SQL Data Analysis project involved conducting an exploratory analysis of the HR dataset from Kaggle, with the primary goal of identifying insights related to key employee metrics, including attrition, performance, and compensation. The project showcased the effectiveness of SQL for deriving specific insights and informed decision-making, complemented by a Power BI dashboard for visualization of key findings. I used MS SQL Server to execute the queries, and the results are compiled into a report to present to the organization's stakeholders.
